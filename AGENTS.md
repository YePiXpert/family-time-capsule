# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# Repository workflow

- Work and release only from `main`; do not create feature, fix, release, or temporary build branches.
- Before starting, run `git checkout main`, `git pull --ff-only origin main`, and inspect `git status --short`.
- Commit small, clear milestones and push them to `origin main` by default.
- Do not create pull requests and never force-push.
- After every push, inspect GitHub Actions; repair red CI directly on `main` and push again until it is green.
